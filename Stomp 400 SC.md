The use in the cultivation of aconitum, astilbe, hosta and peony has been assessed according to the "simplified extension procedure".  No efficacy and phytotoxicity studies have been performed for these uses.  It is therefore recommended to carry out a test spray before using the product. Use of this agent in these area(s) of application is at the risk and responsibility of the user.

The use in the cultivation of lupine, kale, parsnips, celeriac, salsify, spring onions, garlic, celery, rhubarb, fennel, aromatic and medicinal herb crops (post emergence) and medicinal root crops (uncovered cultivation) has been assessed in accordance with Article 51 EC 1107/2009  .  No efficacy and phytotoxicity studies have been performed for these uses.  It is therefore recommended to carry out a test spray before using the product.  Use of this product in these areas of application is at the risk and responsibility of the user.

*3 The dosage depends on the soil type

### Application conditions

In the cultivation of kale, use Stomp 400 SC in 500 liters of water per ha.
In order to protect plants not belonging to the target species, use in the cultivation of flower bulbs and flower tubers is only permitted if a technique from at least class DRT90 is used on the entire plot.

In order to protect aquatic organisms, use in all crops with the exception of rocket leaves on plots adjacent to surface water is only permitted if a technique from at least class DRT90 is used on the entire plot, whereby in the cultivation of ware potatoes,  carrots, onions, leeks, flower bulbs and tubers, salsify and asparagus planting material, a cultivation-free zone of at least 150 centimeters, measured from the middle of the last crop row or the last plant in the row to the insertion of the ditch.

In addition, for the cultivation of chicory, rocket leaves, madder, asparagus and garlic, a maximum of 1 application per season is permitted on plots adjacent to surface water.

## Failed cultivation

If a crop fails, it is not recommended to sow beets, onions and grasses as replacement crops in the same year, depending on the dosage, sowing depth and the period between application of Stomp 400 SC and sowing of the replacement crop.

## Crop safety

To prevent damage to crops, the product must not come into contact with seeds.  Sowing should be sufficiently deep, with the seeds well covered with soil.  The use of the product on soils containing more than 35% sludge is therefore not recommended.

After the application of Stomp 400 SC, no grasses can be sown as underfertilized.

For the cultivation of leeks and silverskin onions, it is possible under certain circumstances, in particular in the case of slow development, some yellowing or growth retardation of the crop.  This generally leads not to loss of revenue.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

***

 Consult your advisor and/or supplier before applying and apply according to good agricultural practice.

### Product stewardship

Consult the "Emission Restriction Toolbox" on www.toolboxwater.nl.  Find out what measures you can take to limit emissions to surface water.

### General

When there are crops in the immediate vicinity that can be harvested in the coming days or weeks, good agricultural practices should be carefully applied in relation to these neighboring crops.  Drift to these crops should always be avoided.  Any agreements between both parties can be useful for this.

Stomp 400 SC is a soil herbicide effective against annual grasses and dicots weeds. The product is effective against dusk, windhalm, meadow grass and barnyard grass.  Green needlepoint and finger grasses are less sensitive.  Almost all major dicotyledonous field weeds are susceptible with the exception of cornflower, knobweed, ragwort and vetch.

For optimum effect, a sufficiently moist and settled soil is necessary during and after application.  On dry soil and in dry conditions after application, the effect may be disappointing.  On soil types with more than 10% humus, the effect may be disappointing.

## Re-entry

After a crop treatment, only re-enter after the spray liquid has dried;  work can then be carried out without the use of protective measures.
